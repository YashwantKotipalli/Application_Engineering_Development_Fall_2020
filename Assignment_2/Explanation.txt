In order to model a ride from location A to location B, we would have to include a button named "Book a Cab", which on clicked will display a JPanel on the right side using the card layout. The JPanel will include 2 attributes of "Pickup Point" and "Destination", and while entering the text in those fields, It would suggest us the location automatically using a connection to a map api, where we can select the pickup and drop points, we can select the number of seats we are looking for, which will link to a pricing model. A backend API can be used to detect trackers in the cars in the nearby location to that of the pickup point and determine the location of the nearest vehicle with respect to the pickup point. We can also use the same trackers the cars for the customer to share the location of their cab they are travelling in, to their firends or relatives just to keep them informed.
